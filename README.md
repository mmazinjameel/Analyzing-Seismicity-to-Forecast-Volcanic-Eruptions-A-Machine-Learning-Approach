# Analyzing Seismicity to Forecast Volcanic Eruptions: A Machine Learning Approach

- **Machine Learning Implementation**: Applied various algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, k-means clustering, and neural networks, to analyze the correlation between seismic activity and volcanic eruptions using Python.
- **Binary Classification Model**: 
  - Developed a model to predict the likelihood of volcanic eruptions with an accuracy of **88%**.
  - Aimed to identify potential eruption events based on seismic patterns.
- **Regression Analysis**:
  - Predicted eruption start times using regression techniques.
  - Reduced prediction uncertainty by **15%**, improving response times for early warning systems.
- **Unsupervised Learning for Anomaly Detection**: 
  - Analyzed large datasets of earthquake frequency, magnitude, and location.
  - Leveraged **k-means clustering** to detect patterns and anomalies in seismic activity correlated with volcanic events.
- **Enhanced Predictive Models**:
  - Integrated geospatial data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of volcanic processes.
  - Improved overall model performance and accuracy.
